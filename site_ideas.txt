Muffin,

I just texted you an image of a doodle as a thought for pattern that could make up the different buttons. That may be too hard to accomplish, but I could send it to you a pattern like that as a png or something? Do you have the capability of making a button change color when the mouse hovers over it or clicks it? In terms of colors, I was thinking something like these colors you see here. Maybe like the green orange and blue? 

Whatever color button you click could correspond to triggered hue change of the photograph. I think it probably makes sense for the buttons to link you to the soundcloud and fb page, etc. as you had done what you sent me. 

Again, just let me know what's too complicated and then we can go from there. 

yours in AdMo(ration) ;) :p ;*,
